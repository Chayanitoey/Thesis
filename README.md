# Perfect Laundry Day

This repository is part of a thesis / visual essay created
by [Chay Chayanit Thawaranont](https://chayanitoey.com/) in support of a graduate school thesis for the Masters of Science in Data Visualization at Parsons School of Design, The New School.

## The Data

The data used in this project was mainly collected from various existing academic research papers and official laundry care guides. These sources include the labeling rule from the Federal Trade Commission's "Complying with the Care Labeling Rule" guide, the Consumer Behaviour on Washing Report from Mistra Future Fashion, and the EPA Environmental Protection Agency's data on textiles in municipal solid waste (MSW) . Additionally, many other research papers were used and their direct links to the data can be found in the sources section below.

## Environment Variables

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Documentation

This visual essay was built with Svelte, SvelteKit and D3 , deployed on Cloudflare. I also used the help of the Scroller.svelte library for scroll events, svelte-hamburgers, pancake.svelte for Stacked Bar Chart, LayerCake.svelte for dot plot chart, and Scroller UI for the database UI components.
